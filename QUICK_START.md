## 🚀 Next Steps

### STEP 1: Use Claude Code to Build

Open a new terminal in this directory and run:

```bash
claude code
```

Then paste the contents of **`CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md`** into Claude Code.

Claude Code will build the system in 5 stages:
1. Foundation (proxy server + brain module loading)
2. Split-screen interface (HTML/CSS/JS)
3. Preview system (live mockup rendering)
4. File management (upload + save)
5. Testing (validate everything works)

**If Claude Code loses context:** Just reference the stage number and it can resume.

### STEP 2: Populate Brain Modules with Perplexity

After the build completes, use Perplexity to fill these 3 files:

**personality.json:**
- Nitya's character (22, Texas, wedding sales)
- Communication style (playful, confident, empathetic)
- Signature phrases
- NO PRICING NUMBERS

**sales.json:**
- Traffic light system (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)
- NLP techniques
- Objection handling
- Closing techniques
- NO PRICING NUMBERS

**web_landing.json:**
- Discovery questions for each section
- Section templates (hero, about, services, contact)
- Workflow rules
- NO PRICING NUMBERS

**pricing.json:**
- Already populated! ($40/$199/$26 pricing)
- THE ONLY FILE with price numbers

### STEP 3: Test the System

Once built and brain modules populated:

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm start

# Terminal 2
cd public
python -m http.server 8080
```

Open: `http://localhost:8080`

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES TO REMEMBER

### Rule #1: Pricing Centralization
**NO PRICE NUMBERS ANYWHERE EXCEPT `pricing.json`**

When populating brain modules with Perplexity, make sure to tell it:
- "NO pricing numbers in this file"
- "All pricing must reference pricing.json"
- "Only describe pricing rules, not actual numbers"

### Rule #2: Modular Design
Each brain module has ONE job:
- personality.json = WHO she is
- sales.json = HOW she sells
- web_landing.json = WHAT she asks
- pricing.json = NUMBERS and pricing rules

### Rule #3: Lightweight Code
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no React/Vue/Angular)
- Use existing design tokens from global.css
- Keep it simple and maintainable

## 📋 Build Stages Reference

If you need to pause and resume with Claude Code:

**STAGE 1: Foundation**
- Brain module loading
- Proxy server setup
- System prompt builder

**STAGE 2: Interface**
- Split-screen HTML
- Chat panel (left)
- Preview panel (right)
- Styling with design tokens

**STAGE 3: Preview**
- Section rendering (hero, about, services, contact)
- Live updates as user types
- Approval button logic

**STAGE 4: Files**
- Upload endpoint
- Save section data
- Generate scope.json
- Create prospect directories

**STAGE 5: Testing**
- Validate all flows
- Check pricing rule compliance
- Test file uploads
- Verify section progression

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The system is complete when:

✅ Chat interface loads and responds  
✅ Split-screen layout works  
✅ Preview updates in real-time  
✅ File uploads work  
✅ Section approval saves data  
✅ scope.json generates correctly  
✅ NO pricing numbers outside pricing.json

## 📚 Documentation Reference

**For Claude Code:**
- `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md` - Complete build instructions

**For Strategy:**
- `NITYA.md` - Full vision and technical specs

**For History:**
- `CHANGELOG.md` - What we learned in V1.0

**For Quick Ref:**
- `README.md` - Overview and quick start

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Claude Code can't find files?**
- Make sure you're in the NITYA_V1.1 directory
- Check file paths in the prompt

**Pricing appearing in wrong files?**
- Search all JSON files for dollar signs ($)
- Only pricing.json should have numbers

**API key not working?**
- Check config.js has your key
- Verify .gitignore protects config.js

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Stage your commits:** After each Claude Code stage, commit to git
2. **Test incrementally:** Don't wait until the end to test
3. **Keep it modular:** Each file should have one clear purpose
4. **Document as you go:** Update CHANGELOG.md with discoveries

---

## 🎓 What Makes This Different from V1.0

**V1.0 Problems:**
- Files scattered everywhere
- Pricing hardcoded in multiple places
- No clear structure
- Hard to maintain

**V1.1 Solutions:**
- Clean folder structure
- Centralized pricing (pricing.json ONLY)
- Modular brain architecture
- Clear build stages
- Ready for Claude Code

---

## ✅ You're Ready!

Everything is set up. Just:
1. Run `claude code`
2. Paste `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md`
3. Let it build in stages
4. Populate brain modules with Perplexity
5. Test and iterate

---

**Built with:** Lessons from V1.0  
**Architecture:** Modular, lightweight, maintainable  
**Status:** Ready for execution
