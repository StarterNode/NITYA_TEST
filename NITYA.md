## 📁 THE CORE INNOVATION: The Prospect Folder + The "Holy Shit" Moment

### What Nitya Actually Does

**Nitya's Real Job:** Fill a folder with structured data, then USE that data to generate a working mockup.

**The Innovation:** She doesn't just collect requirements - she shows prospects EXACTLY what they're getting.

**Not:** "Tell me what you want and we'll build it"  
**Yes:** "Here's what you described, looking exactly like you imagined it"

### The Complete Conversation Flow

#### Phase 1: Pure Data Collection (No Styling)

**Nitya's approach:** "Don't get hung up on styling - we're just gathering puzzle pieces."

- "What pages do you need?" → sitemap.json
- "What's your business name?" → metadata.json
- "Got a domain?" → metadata.json
- "Email and phone?" → metadata.json
- "Social media?" → metadata.json
- "Upload logo" → assets/icons/
- "Got images?" → assets/images/

**Preview:** Shows raw data organized simply

#### Phase 2: Brand Identity Education

**Nitya educates on proper branding:**

> "When building a brand identity, it's important we don't just say 'red' or 'green' - we get down to the HEX. Give me a few colors or even a gradient that really communicates your brand and we can incorporate that into the design."

**User provides:** Colors (Nitya helps convert to HEX if needed)

**Nitya:** "Perfect! [STYLES: primaryColor=#FF5733, secondaryColor=#440DC3]"

> "Same goes with fonts - what typography speaks to your brand? Something bold? Something elegant?"

**User provides:** Font preferences

**Nitya:** "Great choice! [STYLES: fontHeading=Montserrat, fontBody=Open Sans]"

→ Updates styles.css with collected brand data

#### Phase 3: The Magic Moment 🎯

**Nitya:** "Okay, now let's apply a style to this. Let's pick an existing website that you absolutely love that we can model to fit your exact vibe."

**User provides:** Reference site URL (e.g., "https://www.mxpx.com/")

**Nitya:** "Excellent taste! [STYLES: referenceUrl=https://www.mxpx.com/] Let me build your mockup now..."

**Then Nitya:**
1. Reads sitemap.json (pages/structure)
2. Reads metadata.json (business content)
3. Reads styles.css (colors/fonts/reference)
4. Analyzes reference site (layout/template)
5. **Generates index.html** - A functional website with THEIR data in THEIR style

**Preview updates with REAL working mockup**

**Prospect sees:**
- Their business name and logo
- Their brand colors and fonts
- Layout styled like the site they loved
- Their actual content and images
- A REAL website, not placeholders

**Prospect thinks:** "Holy shit, that's MY business!"

**Nitya:** "This is what we're building - does this capture your vision?"

**Result:** Instant buy-in. Deal closed. Prospect becomes client.

### The Prospect Folder Structure

```
/prospects/UID_12345/
├── sitemap.json          ← What pages they need
├── metadata.json         ← Business info, domain, social URLs
├── styles.css            ← Brand colors (HEX), fonts, reference site
├── index.html            ← 🎯 THE HOOK - Working mockup that closes deals
├── assets/
│   ├── icons/
│   │   └── logo.png      ← Their logo
│   └── images/
│       ├── hero.jpg      ← All uploaded images
│       ├── about.jpg
│       └── team.jpg
└── conversation.json     ← Full chat history for designer context
```

**The Key Files:**

1. **index.html** - THE SELLING POINT
   - Working mockup using prospect's data
   - Styled like their reference site
   - This is what converts them
   
2. **sitemap.json, metadata.json, styles.css** - Data for designers
   - Complete structured requirements
   - Designers rebuild properly using this data
   - No guessing required

3. **assets/** - Ready-to-use media
   - Logo organized in icons/
   - All images organized in images/
   - Designers just import

4. **conversation.json** - Full context
   - Every message saved
   - Designers can reference any clarifications
   - Complete audit trail

### Folder Creation Flow

**Account Created** → UID generated → Folder structure created:
```bash
mkdir -p prospects/UID_12345/assets/icons
mkdir -p prospects/UID_12345/assets/images
```

**As Nitya Talks** → Files get filled:
- Asks about pages → Updates sitemap.json
- Asks about business → Updates metadata.json
- Shows reference site → Updates styles.css
- Collects logo → Saves to assets/icons/
- Collects images → Saves to assets/images/
- Every message → Appends to conversation.json

**Conversation Complete** → Designer gets complete folder with everything needed

## 🎨 The Interactive Preview System

### Purpose of the Preview

**NOT:** The final website  
**YES:** A sketch to show what we're building

**Nitya explains this upfront:**
> "Quick heads up - StarterNode is a turnkey design agency. Our goal is to make sure your site increases visibility through SEO and converts visitors into customers. This conversation is just to gather details and create a mockup sketch. I'll ask questions, you answer, and we'll draft it together. Then our design team polishes it and makes it beautiful. Don't worry if you don't have everything ready - we're just getting started!"

### How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
```

### Section-by-Section Workflow

Nitya asks concise questions (1-2 sentences) and fills files as she goes:

1. **Pages needed** → Updates sitemap.json
2. **Business info** → Updates metadata.json  
3. **Reference site + colors** → Updates styles.css
4. **Logo upload** → Saves to assets/icons/
5. **Images upload** → Saves to assets/images/

**Key Principle:** Keep momentum. If they don't have something, use placeholder and move on.

---

## 🔄 The Complete User Flow

### Step 1: Landing Page
**starternode.com/services/websites**

**Message:** "Most people use Wix because it's hard to explain what you want to a designer. With StarterNode, Nitya helps you visualize exactly what you want - then our team builds the real thing."

CTA: **"Chat with Nitya"**

### Step 2: Account Creation
- Name, Email, Password
- UID generated (e.g., UID_12345)
- Prospect folder created
- Instant access to chat

### Step 3: Nitya's Opening
> "Hey! I'm Nitya, StarterNode's Lead Design Consultant. I'm here to gather everything our team needs to build your perfect website. Quick thing - what we're building together is a visual sketch so designers know exactly what you want. Then they build the real thing! Ready? Do you have a site already or are we building from scratch?"

### Step 4: Discovery & Folder Filling

**Questions Nitya Asks:**
1. "What pages do you need?" → sitemap.json
2. "What's your business name?" → metadata.json
3. "Got a domain?" → metadata.json
4. "What's your email and phone?" → metadata.json
5. "Any social media links?" → metadata.json
6. "Show me a website you absolutely love" → styles.css (reference)
7. "What are your brand colors?" → styles.css (educate on hex if needed)
8. "Upload your logo" → assets/icons/
9. "Got any images?" → assets/images/

**Each answer updates the folder in real-time.**

### Step 5: Complete Folder
When all essential info collected:
- sitemap.json ✅
- metadata.json ✅
- styles.css ✅
- assets/icons/logo.png ✅
- conversation.json ✅

### Step 6: Designer Handoff
- Email sent to design team
- Folder link: `/prospects/UID_12345/`
- Designer builds real site using folder as complete brief

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation (Phase 3)

### Backend Architecture

**New API Endpoints:**

```javascript
POST /api/update-sitemap
POST /api/update-metadata
POST /api/update-styles
POST /api/save-conversation
POST /api/upload (enhanced for icons vs images)
```

**File Writing Logic:**
```javascript
// When Nitya collects pages
router.post('/api/update-sitemap', async (req, res) => {
    const { userId, pages } = req.body;
    const sitemap = { pages, updatedAt: new Date().toISOString() };
    await fs.writeFile(
        `./prospects/${userId}/sitemap.json`,
        JSON.stringify(sitemap, null, 2)
    );
});

// When Nitya collects business info
router.post('/api/update-metadata', async (req, res) => {
    const { userId, data } = req.body;
    let metadata = await readExisting(`./prospects/${userId}/metadata.json`);
    metadata = { ...metadata, ...data, updatedAt: new Date().toISOString() };
    await fs.writeFile(
        `./prospects/${userId}/metadata.json`,
        JSON.stringify(metadata, null, 2)
    );
});

// When Nitya collects colors/fonts
router.post('/api/update-styles', async (req, res) => {
    const { userId, styles } = req.body;
    const css = generateCSS(styles);
    await fs.writeFile(`./prospects/${userId}/styles.css`, css);
});
```

### Frontend Detection

**Tagging Protocol:**

Nitya uses tags in her responses that frontend detects:

```
Nitya: "Perfect! [SITEMAP: home, about, menu, contact] Got those pages noted."
```

Frontend sees `[SITEMAP: ...]` and calls:
```javascript
await fetch('/api/update-sitemap', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ userId, pages: ['home', 'about', 'menu', 'contact'] })
});
```

**Detection Examples:**
- `[SITEMAP: ...]` → Update sitemap.json
- `[METADATA: businessName=Austin Tacos]` → Update metadata.json
- `[STYLES: primaryColor=#FF5733]` → Update styles.css

### System Prompt Addition

```
# YOUR REAL JOB

You are Nitya, StarterNode's Lead Design Consultant.

Your goal: Fill the prospect folder with structured data.

## Files You Must Complete:

1. sitemap.json - Pages needed
2. metadata.json - Business information  
3. styles.css - Visual direction
4. assets/ - Collect logo and images

## Setting Expectations:

Tell them upfront: "StarterNode is a turnkey design agency. Our goal is to make sure your site increases visibility through SEO and converts visitors. This conversation is just to gather details and create a mockup. I'll ask questions, you answer, and we draft it together. Then our design team polishes it. Don't worry if you don't have everything - we're just getting started!"

## How to Behave:

- Ask ONE question at a time (1-2 sentences)
- Use tags when collecting data: [SITEMAP: ...], [METADATA: ...], [STYLES: ...]
- Educate when needed (hex codes, branding basics)
- Keep momentum (no perfection needed)
- Be warm, confident, and efficient
```
